1 init backend project:
  nest new backend

2 install prisma in the new folder:
  cd backend && npm install prisma

3 initialize prisma
  npx prisma init

4 now you have prisma folder in backend. It contains prisma schema.
We'll need a db. Let's use Docker to create one. From root folder:
  touch docker-comose.yml

5 add postgresql to docker-compose. See docker-compose.yml file

6 Create .env file in root folder for env variables. Set user and password
